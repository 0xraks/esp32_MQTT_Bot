# esp32_MQTT_Car
4 WD Bot that can be controlled by WiFi. The bot responds to commands over MQTT protocol. The 4 wheel can be driven individually. 
The bot has a obstacle sensing mode that uses proximity sensors on the front and on the back to detect obstacles and reverse its direction.


Upcoming features:
<br > Magnetic charging dock <br />
<br >Onboarding measuring of battery voltage <br />
<br >Machine Learning mode - the bot predicts obstacles if it had encountered it before,even before the proximity obstacle detector senses it  <br />
<br >Line Following mode - can follow predefined paths using proximity sensors(uses insfrared to detect black/white patterens). <br />
<br >Returns to charging docks by following line, when the battery  becomes low. <br />
